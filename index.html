         <h2>Housing </h2>
         <p>You can find housing through a number channels:</p>
         <br>
         <ul>
            <li>(Facebook) Muslim Housing South Bay Area: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2012955445647287/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2012955445647287/</a></li>
            <li>(Slack) The housing channel on Bay Area Muslims: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bayareamuslims">http://tinyurl.com/bayareamuslims</a></li>
            <li>(Facebook) UC Berkeley Muslim Brothers Housing: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/813694905393961/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/813694905393961/</a></li>
            <li>(In-person) Going to different Mosques and creating a flyer + contacting the people who posted flyers.  You can view the list of Mosques below. Here’s an example of how it looks like: <a href="https://ibb.co/mEwtap">https://ibb.co/mEwtap</a></li>
         </ul>
         <br>
         <p>Right now, there’s isn’t a single location to find housing which isn’t very efficient. For now, it’s best if you utilize all these channels.</p>
         <br>
         <p>If you’re interested in renting a room / apartment and want a volunteer to check it out and send you pictures or tell you how the area is like, email <a href="mailto:housing@muslim.events">housing@muslim.events</a>. </p>
         <br>
         <p>Finally, If you’re new and are looking to stay in a place for <7 days until you find a place and settle, a few people expressed their interest in hosting newcomers. Email <a href="mailto:housing@muslim.events">housing@muslim.events</a> and we’ll match you with someone insha’Allah.</p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <h2>Events</h2>
         <p>Events are a great way for you to meet and get to know other Muslims. You can view all the muslim events on <a href="https://muslim.events">https://muslim.events</a>. You can also find events by checking the web / facebook pages of the Mosques below. </p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
         <h2>Interns</h2>
         <p>There’s a group called Minterns for Muslim interns in the Bay. It's in the form of a group chat and an announcements page. Minterns is most active during the summer but it exists throughout the year.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Message <a href="https://m.me/anique.davla">https://m.me/anique.davla</a> to be added to the group chat.</p>
         <br>
         <p>You can find the announcements page over here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bayareamusliminterns/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/bayareamusliminterns/</a></p>
